**Q: What is spirituality?**   
A: There are many different answers to this question. The way we think of it in the Ordinary Relating philosophy is the practice of experiential philosophy. Spirituality is what happens when you sit with questions that don't have answers. Put another way, it is the practice of simply seeing what it's like to momentarily turn away from the hustle and bustle of life. It's the practice of just being with what is. Then just being what is, and not being at all.  

**Q: What is spiritual growth?**   
A: If you practice spirituality as defined above more than just occasionally, spiritual growth is inevitable. There are many aspects to spiritual growth, and it occurs uniquely for everyone (even though we all share our ordinariness). Spiritual growth could be thought of as an aspect of psychological growth and maturity, or vice versa. Generally speaking, spiritual growth entails looking inward and expanding outward. Signs of spiritual growth: greater ease and greater discomfort; struggling with paradox; and confusion, clarity, great patience, and great urgency.
